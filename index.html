            <p>Happy 3 months, my love.</p>
            <p>I can’t believe it’s already been three months. I wanted to write this to tell you how much I appreciate you, and also to apologize for blowing up your phone lately. I know I’ve been double-texting a lot and getting a bit paranoid when you’re busy. Please know that it’s never because I don't trust you; it’s honestly just because I’m obsessed with you, like sooooo obsessed (like retardedly obsessed). I get a little worried sometimes, but that's only because I care about you so much and I just miss you 24/7.</p>
            <p>That being said... please forgive me in advance because I am definitely not going to stop spamming you with practically my entire FYP and random weird stuff. You’re just going to have to deal with that, because sharing everything with you is just what I do.</p>
            <p>I love that we have that kind of connection. I feel like we can talk about literally anything forever, but even when we don't have anything to say, the silence with you is never awkward. I love the way you smile, and I honestly love everything about you. I really hope this lasts.</p>
            <p>Also, I want to wish you the best of luck with your exams and projects. I know that’s why you’ve been so busy and locked in (so nonchalant bruh), and I respect how hard you work. You are so smart and I know you are going to absolutely crush it. I’ll be right here cheering for you and waiting patiently to get your attention back, like a cat that hasn't been petted for 5 seconds.</p>
            <p>I love you so much. i miss you so much i hope we can go on dates again soon</p>
